## User Story - Elevator Pitch

As a real estate investor, I want a useful, online tool with up-to-date information from knowledgeable sources that will help me determine whether or not an investment has an adequate ROI. 
PropPlanner is robust and granular enough to plan the investment all the way through a 5 year window, calculating income and expenses to organize a very real expectation of your investment. 
While the primary purpose of PropPlanner is a real estate investment calculator, it is much more than an amortization or financial calculator because it follows through with touch-points that a property owner should expect, but also includes some of the things that tenants expect that may not be considered by the property owner. 
PropPlanner is a resource for accurate information, and acts as a central location for the information regarding your investment property, including visual graphs to help you visualize comparisons between your investment and your return.
